#using the data already built into emacs/R, mtcars, we are using
 #subset()# to filter the collumns/row
 example:
	subset(mtcars, disp > 300)
	filters mtcars by cars that have a displacement greater than 300

	subset(mtcars, carb ==4)$disp
	filters mtcars by cars with carb over 4 but is only extracting
	data from collumn named disp
