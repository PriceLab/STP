This chapter of the book talks more on the topic of circuits and
connections. One thing the chapter mentions is common, which is when
two circular circuits still operate independantly but are joined like
siamese twins. When using this type of circuit with lightbulbs, a
person in the house next door can control your light switch with
theirs as they are now joined. Something new this chapter also talks about
is the idea of earth as a conductor for energy. Although earth isnt the best
conductor, in order for it to be one there must be something that
maintains a substantial contact with earth such as a copper pole that
is big in diameter as well as height.

This chapter mentions how we have developed circuits and communication
without being physically present with wires. Not only did we develop a
means of communication that is out of sight, we've made things easier
as wires are no longer limited by distance. You can connect anything
with the right wires and circuits and make the wires as long as you want.

some key terms from this chapter include:
-ground: an electrical contact with the earth
-common: when two circular circuits are conjoined but stll operate
independantly
-zero potential: no voltage is present
-American Wire Gauge: how the thickness of wires can be measured
