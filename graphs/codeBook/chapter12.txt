chapter 12 of the book delves deeper into the topic of circuits,
binary numbers, how theyre translated and used, and the simplicity
and complexicity of it all. The book does a lot of in depth explaining
of how binary codes can translate to a lot of different meaning and
even shows you addition of numbers translated in binary.

A concept that is introduced to me in this chapter is how a pattern of
zeros and ones can trigger either an on or off reaction with
circuits. As gates were explained in previous chapters, it was
mentioned a multiple of times this chapter with the assumption that
the reader has a somewhat understanding of what gates are. Keywords
mentioned in the chapter include NAND date, AND gate, Or agte, XOR
gate, and more. These are all different types of gates that each have
their own specific patern of binary code that makes up the gate.

The addition of binary is important and serves a big role into making
sure circuits work. For example, a carry output from the last binary
pair of numbers is needed for the next pair to be added in order for a
pattern to be formed and numbers to make sense by the
circuit. Something that computers used but dont anymore is relays. Now,
we use transistors. And when used, transistors function the same way
relays do but are much faster, smaller, and quieter- as most things
have become in computation as the years go by.
