	Beginning the book Code, by Charles Petzold, is a story told
in the perspective of a young child trying to rebel against
their parents by staying up late at night to communicate with
their best friend who lives next door. This is at a time where
phones did not exist, so alternate means of ways needed to be
made in order to do so- morse code.

     The first chapter delves into the concept of morse code. How
sailors developed this language that utalizes light and patterns
that can easily be translated into words, numbers, phrases, and
sentences. The main idea of chapter one was the introduction to the
concept of creating a human made means of communication where words
and physical means are not allowed. Morse code is very versitle in
that you only need two things: darkness and a light. Humans realized
there was a need for communication in the dark without being
necessarily vocal, and morse code fulfilled this need.

	    Many might think the idea of morse code is confusing and
impossible to learn. However, just like any language, can
be taught and memorized by anyone with the ambition to do so.
Morse code uses short and long strokes of light that represent each
letter of the alphabet. Not only does each letter has its own
individual pattern, but so do special characters such as ".", "?", and
"!". Altough using morse code to send a message takes a
longer time than speech does, with the average of 5/10 words per
minute using morse and an average of a 100 words per minute using
speech, it serves a need that speech can not fulfill. Morse code is
not a replacement for speech, but rather another form of it.
