This chapter of the book code dives into the topic of "bit"- finally
code related. The concept of off and on, zeros and ones, closed or open,
is mentioned multiple times in this chapter as that has everything to
do with coding and bit. Bit is often times hidden and deep within
computer and electronic systems. Bit is not something we see but
rather, the motor that makes everything work.

The binary system is considered the most
simple number system possible. There are only two numbers in binary: 1
and 0. The binary system is so simple that you can count to 7 using only 3
bits. There are no more 3 digit binary numbers. Everything in bit
consists of zero's and one's. But to most, it seems way more
complicated. Probably because bit can look overwhelming with the
amount of characters there are and how it all consists of only two numbers.

The book goes slightly deep into how binary code is read, comprehended, and the thought
process behind its creation. The biggest concept taken away from this
chapter is the fact that two numbers can create a simple language that
can then be used in ways larger and greater than the simplicity of the
language itself. Bit is then explained in tables how it cana be
interperted. logs, power, and patterns are used to translate bit code.
