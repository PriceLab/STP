This chapter of the book, code, talks more about circuits and how
lightbulbs work. The book mentions networks, switches, and
more. Switches now are completely different than how they were in the
older days. people knew that when you wired two switches in series,
both switches had to be closed for current to flow, and when you wired
two switches in parallel, one or the other had to be closed. But now
you can use boolean algebra to design circuits.

All throughout the book, binary is mentioned, taught, and
explained. Binary, consistent of zeros and ones, looks very
complicated but as the book explains it, seems less daunting and
scary. It is actually very simple. There are 4 place holders for the
zeros and ones. The four place holders represent the numbers "8", "4,
"2", and "1". Depending where the one or zero is according to the
ordering of the placeholders, that is how you can translate the
numbers. The chapter does a better way of explaining this.

Although this chapter touches on a lof of topics, circuits are the
main focus. Binary, as simple as it is consisting of only two numbers,
plays a big role in circuits.The combination of binary code and
numbers decide whether the circuit is on or off with input and
outputs.

Key words:

-inverter: a single relay wired circuit
-logic gate: an inverter with two or more inputs
