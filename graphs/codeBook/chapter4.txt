This chapter of the book delves into a different
topic-flashlights. The author explains how understanding a few
concepts of the anatomy of a flashlight will help with understanding
how it's used inside computers. The chapter goes semi-deep into the topic of
basic chemistry so we can grasp a greater understanding. Atoms,
neutrons, and electrons make up a cell and every single part of the
element is necessary for it to work. If there was a slight change
in something just as little as an extra proton, the element
would be  different, function different, and might even have a
different state of being.

An important concept to grasp from the anatomy of an atom is the
negative and positive charges. Atoms are made of electrons,
which are negative, and protons, which are positive. A battery has the
same concept. No matter the size, each battery has a positive and
negative charge and its important to align negative-to-positive and
positive-to-negative in order for the appliance using the battery to
work. In these cases, opposites attract. Positive only works when
paired with negative and vice versa.

Something this chapter talks about that I think can be related back to
computational code is precision. While the focus on this chapter
is the anatomy of a lightbulb and how it functions, the chapter goes
into detail how just the misplacement of one single wire can cause the
whole lightbulb not to work even if everything is perfectly in
place. This relates to code in the sense that you can have a perfectly
working project but one single character or letter out-of-place can
cause the code to malfunction or not work at all.
