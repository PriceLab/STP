This chapter of the book talks more about the number system we use
today and how you can easily develop number systems for anything.
This chapter talks about the importance of the
number ten- how ten is important because most of us have ten fingers
and toes and that is how we first started to count things before a
number system existed. Two systems thatre mentioned a lot in this
chapter are the octal system and the decimal system.The octal system
is like any ordinary counting number system except you skip any number
that has an eight or nine in it. This can be referred to cartoon
characters and how they only have 8 fingers total; 4 on each
hand. Counting to ten using the octal system goes: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10-
one hand counting 1,2,3,4, and the other counting 5,6,7,10.

Although the octal system seems strange, it is just as valid a
counting system as the decimal system is. With that in mind, we can
also create a number system for a lobster who only posesses 4
"fingers"- a quanternary system. Counting in quanternary goes like:0,
1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33, 100, and so
forth. Notice how each number in this system correlates to the power
of four.

With those concepts being introduced, the book then goes into the
topic of binary code and how it is structured. The binary system is
consistent of zero's and one's and although it can be hard on the eyes
to look at and comprehend at first, it really is way more simple than
the eyes meet. For example, a switch can be a binary digit. It being
off means 0 and it being on means 1. A lightbulb can be  a binary
digit- off meaning 0 and lit meaning 1. While this chapter was merely
an introduction to binary and the number system, binary has a lot to
do with computers!
